        \tThese Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our services, including our various websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, widgets, ads, commerce services, and our other services that link to these Terms (collectively, the “Services”), and any information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, or other materials or arrangements of materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively referred to as “Content”).

        \n\n\t<b>3. Content on the Services</b>
        \n\n\tYou are responsible for your use of the Services and for any Content you provide, including compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. You should only provide Content that you are comfortable sharing with others.
        \n\n\tAny use or reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Services or obtained by you through the Services is at your own risk. We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications posted via the Services or endorse any opinions expressed via the Services. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive.

        \n\n\tWe reserve the right to remove Content at any moment, including for example, copyright or trademark violations, impersonation, unlawful conduct, or harassment.
        \n\n\t<b>Your Rights</b>
        \n\n\tYou retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. What’s yours is yours — you own your Content (and your photos and videos are part of the Content).
        \n\n\tBy submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).

You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content that you submit.
        \n\n\t<b>4. Using the Services</b>
        \n\n\tOur Services evolve constantly. As such, the Services may change from time to time, at our discretion.
